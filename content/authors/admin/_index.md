I am an Assistant Professor at Hanyang University ERICA. My research focuses on Security and Privacy issues related to mobile and IoT systems. I have been studying vulnerabilities and design problems in Android OS, Android and iOS malware detection, access control designs and applications for smartphones and IoT systems, and protection systems for smartspeakers.
